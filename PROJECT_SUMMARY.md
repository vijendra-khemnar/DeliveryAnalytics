**🔍 Step-by-Step Code Execution:**

##### **1. Query Reception (`main()` function)**
```python
query = input("🔍 Enter your query: ").strip()
# Input: "Why are deliveries failing in Mumbai and what can we do to improve performance?"
```

##### **2. Query Processing (`process_query()` method)**
```python

    print(f"🔍 Processing query: '{query}'")
    if self.use_perplexity:
        print("🤖 Using Perplexity AI for enhanced processing")
```

##### **3. AI-Enhanced Query Parsing**

**A. Primary AI Path (`parse_query_with_perplexity()`)**
```python
def parse_query_with_perplexity(self, query):
    # Constructs AI prompt with available entities
    prompt = f'''
    Analyze this delivery logistics query: "{query}"
    Available Cities: {available_cities}
    Return JSON with intent, entities, confidence...
    '''
    
    ai_response = self.call_perplexity_api(prompt)
    # Returns: {"intent": "explain_causes", "entities": {"cities": ["Mumbai"]}, "confidence": 1.0}
```

**B. API Call with Retry Logic (`call_perplexity_api()`)**
```python
def call_perplexity_api(self, prompt, max_retries=3):
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {PERPLEXITY_API_KEY}"}
    payload = {
        "model": "sonar",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        "max_tokens": 1000,
        "temperature": 0.2
    }
    
    response = requests.post("https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions", ...)
    # Returns AI-generated structured response
```

**C. Fallback Path (if AI fails)**
```python
def parse_query_rule_based(self, query):
    # Pattern matching for cities, intents, time references
    cities = ['mumbai', 'delhi', ...]
    mentioned_cities = [city for city in cities if city in query.lower()]
    # Returns: {"intent": "explain_causes", "cities": ["mumbai"]}
```

##### **4. Data Filtering (`filter_data()` method)**
```python
def filter_data(self, filters):
    df = self.integrated_df.copy()
    if 'cities' in filters:
        df = df[df['city'].str.lower().isin(['mumbai'])]
    # Returns: Filtered dataset with 673 Mumbai orders
```

##### **5. Analysis Execution**
```python
if parsed['intent'] == 'explain_causes':
    results = self.explain_delivery_causes(filtered_df)
    # Analyzes root causes, calculates metrics, identifies patterns
```

##### **6. AI-Enhanced Recommendation Generation**

        'revenue_impact': 202600.72,
        'top_causes': ['Other/Unknown'],
        'affected_cities': ['Mumbai']
    }
    
    prompt = f'''
    Based on delivery analytics: {context}
    Provide structured recommendations:
    **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (0-30 days):**
    **SHORT-TERM IMPROVEMENTS (1-3 months):**
    **STRATEGIC INITIATIVES (3-6 months):**
    '''
    
    ai_recommendations = self.call_perplexity_api(prompt)
    # Returns: Structured business recommendations
```

##### **7. Executive Summary Generation (`generate_executive_summary()`)**
```python
def generate_executive_summary(self, analysis_results, original_query):
    prompt = f'''
    Create executive summary for: "{original_query}"
    Key Findings: {analysis_results}
    
    Generate 3-paragraph summary covering:
    **SITUATION OVERVIEW:** Current performance and challenges
    **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:** Issues and business impact  
    **STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:** Top priorities
    '''
    
    summary = self.call_perplexity_api(prompt)
    # Returns: Professional executive-level analysis
```

##### **8. Response Assembly**
```python
response = {
    'query': query,
    'analysis_type': 'explain_causes',
    'results': results,
    'recommendations': ai_recommendations,      # AI-generated
    'executive_summary': executive_summary,    # AI-generated
    'ai_enhanced': True,
    'parsing_confidence': 1.0,
    'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
}
```

##### **9. Formatted Display (`display_results()`)**
```python
def display_results(self, response):
    print("📊 DELIVERY ANALYTICS REPORT")
    print(f"🤖 AI-Enhanced Analysis (Confidence: {response['parsing_confidence']})")
    
    # Shows executive summary
    if response.get('executive_summary'):
        print("📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY")
        print(response['executive_summary'])
    
    # Shows AI recommendations
    if recommendations.get('source') == 'perplexity_ai':
        print("🤖 AI-Generated Recommendations:")
        print(recommendations['recommendations'])
```
